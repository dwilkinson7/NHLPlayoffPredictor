2018 playoffs it predicted the first round with 100% accuracy, 2nd round with 50% accuracy. It predicted the Penguins would win the cup, while Washington (who beat the Penguins) ended up winning it.
It was very conservative with its guesses (not many upset predictions).
Needs more tuning and improvements.
